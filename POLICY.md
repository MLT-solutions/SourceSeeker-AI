**Privacy Policy for SourceSeeker AI**

1\. Data Collection  
SourceSeeker AI is a local-only application. It scans files on your local storage device (Hard Drive/SSD) solely for the purpose of calculating visual hashes to perform search functions.  

2\. Data Transmission  
No data is transmitted to external servers. All processing, including image hashing and metadata extraction, occurs locally on your machine using your computer's CPU. We do not collect usage statistics, IP addresses, or image data.  

3\. Database  
The application creates a local file named image\_hashes.db on your computer. This contains mathematical representations (hashes) of your images to speed up future searches. This database never leaves your computer.  

4\. Contact  
For privacy concerns, please open a ticket on our GitHub repository.
