### **Description**

**Stop scrolling through thousands of filenames. Find the image you need visually.**

SourceSeeker AI is a powerful, privacy-focused utility designed for digital artists, photographers, and archivists. Unlike standard search tools that look for file names, SourceSeeker analyzes the *content* of your images to find matches, even if the filename has been changed or the image has been resized.

**Key Features:**

* **Visual Search Engine:** Drop a low-res preview or screenshot to find the original high-quality file on your hard drive.  
* **Privacy First:** All scanning happens 100% offline on your device. No images are uploaded to the cloud.  
* **Smart Caching:** Uses a high-performance SQLite database to make repeated scans of large folders instant.  
* **AI Metadata Reader:** Specifically built for AI Artists—view and copy prompts, seeds, and workflow data from images created with Stable Diffusion, Automatic1111, or ComfyUI.  
* **Workflow Efficiency:** Right-click to open file locations, copy generation data, or delete duplicates directly from the app.
