### **General Usage Guide**

**How to find the High-Res version of an image:**

1. **Load the Reference:**  
   * Do you have a small blurry version of the image? Drag and drop it into the "Reference Image" box on the left.  
   * *Tip:* You can also copy an image from a website to your clipboard and click "Paste Clipboard".
     
2. **Choose the Hunting Ground:**  
   * Click "Select Folder". Choose the main folder where you keep your photos (e.g., "D:\\My Art Library").  
   * *Note:* The app searches all sub-folders automatically.
     
3. **Start the Scan:**  
   * Click **START SCAN**.  
   * *First Run:* The first time you scan a huge folder, it might take a few minutes. The app is building a "fingerprint" database.  
   * *Next Run:* Searching that same folder again will be almost instant\!
     
4. **Analyze Results:**  
   * Look at the **Distance** column.  
     * 0: Exact match.  
     * 1-5: Very similar (likely the same image but resized or different format).  
   * Look at the **Size** column. Find the file with the largest MB size—that is your high-res original\!
     
5. **View Metadata:**  
   * Click on any result file. If it was generated by AI, the bottom right text box will show the Seed, Prompt, and Model details.
